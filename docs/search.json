    "text": "Dynamic Scenario Generation\nThe dynamic scenario generation engine produces personalized SAP/ERP business cases based on learners’ backgrounds, prior performance, and interaction patterns with the GenAI Tutor. It selects contextual parameters such as industry, organization size, transaction type, and data complexity to tailor each scenario to the learner’s needs. The system integrates structured prompt templates with LLM-driven variability to create realistic process tasks across modules. This customization helps students engage more deeply with enterprise concepts while reducing reliance on static, one-size-fits-all instructional materials."

    "section": "Interactive LLM Tutoring",
    "text": "Interactive LLM Tutoring\nThe interactive tutoring component provides guided, context-aware support as learners work through SAP/ERP tasks. The GenAI Tutor interprets student questions, identifies the underlying process step or concept, and responds with targeted hints rather than complete solutions. It adapts explanations based on the learner’s prior actions, error patterns, and demonstrated understanding. By combining procedural knowledge with natural language interaction, the system helps students navigate complex enterprise processes while promoting conceptual reasoning instead of rote follow-along execution."

    "text": "Learning Analytics Dashboard\nThe instructor dashboard visualizes learner engagement and performance patterns generated through interactions with the GenAI Tutor. It summarizes key metrics such as active learners, session time, completion rate, and concept mastery. The dashboard integrates time-series activity trends, module-level progress charts, and detailed logs of learner actions. These analytics enable instructors to quickly identify learning bottlenecks, monitor class-wide progress, and adjust instruction accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Analytics Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nScalable AI Instruction Prototype\nThe scalable AI instruction prototype provides a modular, cloud-based infrastructure that supports flexible deployment across ERP and enterprise systems courses. It integrates AWS EC2/RDS services with LLM APIs to manage computation, data storage, and model interaction reliably. The architecture separates presentation, logic, and analytics layers, enabling seamless updates, feature expansion, and cross-platform compatibility. This design ensures that the system can be adopted across different courses, programs, and institutions with minimal configuration effort."
