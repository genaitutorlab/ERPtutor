It selects contextual parameters such as industry, organization size, transaction type, and data complexity to tailor each scenario to the learner’s needs. The system integrates structured prompt templates with LLM-driven variability to create realistic process tasks across modules. This customization helps students engage more deeply with enterprise concepts while reducing reliance on static, one-size-fits-all instructional materials.\n\n\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.",

    "text": "The interactive tutoring component provides guided, context-aware support as learners work through SAP/ERP tasks. The GenAI Tutor interprets student questions, identifies the underlying process step or concept, and responds with targeted hints rather than complete solutions. It adapts explanations based on the learner’s prior actions, error patterns, and demonstrated understanding. By combining procedural knowledge with natural language interaction, the system helps students navigate complex enterprise processes while promoting conceptual reasoning instead of rote follow-along execution.\n\n\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.",
